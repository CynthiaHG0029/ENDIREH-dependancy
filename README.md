 ENDIREH - INEGI Analysis (National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships)

The National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships is only applied to women by women, it seeks information about habits, several types of violence, income, labour, household dyanmics with the partner, mental health, etc.Therefore it is a great tool to explore the prevalence of psychological violence against women which is by itself very difficult to measure by other means as lawsuits or other forms of legal action, cause there are none. I explore the prevalence of psychological violence by their intimate partner and its types, all this in two groups of women: independent (working women who earns a wage), and dependent woman (doesn't work or might work but not for a wage). Explore as well the income of this working women, and explore if the violence they suffer within their relationship was correlated to their income. As well to look closer and question if the violence suffered is different between independent women and autonomous women.

All these DF are later on analized and graphed in tools as RAWgraphs, Flourish, Ai.
